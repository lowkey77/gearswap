Don't feel disparaged if you can't get it working with this alone a lot of people can't when they're first starting messing with these things.

I'll give you a link to my discord, ( https://discord.gg/HqdqQDQ ) and/or you can connect with me through a messenger (They're linked to my FFXIAH account.) If you're relatively computer savvy, it shouldn't be too hard, if not, I'm happy to help explain more or answer questions even if you do get it working.

1.) Go to my dropbox ( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/20vy32liub3glxz/AAAiIVHAasFdwCK1SZdZz7d_a?dl=0 ) and download my entire gearswap folder as a zip file.

2.) Go to your Windower4 folder, if you don't know where it is, you can right click your windower icon and click "Open file location".

3.) In your windower4\scripts folder replace your init.txt with the one you downloaded, this step is skippable, if you don't want to use any of the non-official addons I have found/wrote and don't care about my custom keybinds.

4.) Completely delete your windower4\addons\Gearswap\libs folder just the "libs" folder itself in there and replace it with the libs folder you downloaded from my dropbox.

5.) Completely delete your windower4\addons\Gearswap\data folder just the "data" folder itself in there and replace it with the data folder you downloaded from my dropbox.

6.) Inside your data folder, change the folder named Selindrile to your character's name, then open that folder, and replace all instances of the name Selindrile to your character's name, if you have multiple characters, copy this whole folder, and then rename it and everything inside to another character's name, rinse repeat.

7.) You can review my other addons, some of which I wrote and some of which are collected throughout the internet and download whichever appeal to you and put them in your gearswap\addons folder, some of them automatically load (the ones I use) if you replaced your init.txt file.

8.) Edit your gear, the only files you want to edit are the ones inside your "Character" folder, the ones that I named Selindrile, that you changed, those are the equipment and settings specific to that character, if you have any trouble understanding those, feel free to ask me, preferably through discord or a messenger, if you use FFXIAH or Email, replies will be very slow.

9.) I update my gearswap files frequently, to receive updates without destroying your gear settings, repeat some of the steps above, but do not delete or replace the folder with your character name on it, other than that, replace the rest.

You may reset some of the spell choices in these modes with commands such as:

Export Command for editing gearswap.

//gs export lua    OR    /console gs export lua

Creates a file in Gearswap\Data\Export with your current set detailed as a file, useful for
getting specific augments labelled just right in gearswap, either for putting job specific items
