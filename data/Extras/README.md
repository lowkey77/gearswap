GearSwap-Jobs
=============

Repository for GearSwap lua files for various jobs

To use any of these job luas, you must have the various Mote-* files:
Mote-Include
Mote-Utility
Mote-Globals
Mote-Mappings
Mote-SelfCommands

These files are included in the /libs folder of GearSwap, and automatically updated by the launcher.  If you want to track their development, check https://github.com/Kinematics/Mote-libs

For documentation on how to use these lua scripts, please read the wiki: https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki
